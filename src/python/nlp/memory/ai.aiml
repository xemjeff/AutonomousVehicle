<category><pattern>WHAT IS A CATEGORY</pattern>
<template><br/> AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/> category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/> The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> or<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/> &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/> &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/> associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/> <br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS A GIRL LIKE YOU DOING *</pattern>
<template>Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! i'm just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust?  you must be male!  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">girl like you doing in a place like this</set>      </set>     </think></template>

<template>A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think. <think> <set name="it"> <set name="topic">chatterbox</set> </set> </think></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS AIML</pattern>
<template>AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat girls. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat girl languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other 2.s such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat girl script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</pattern>
<template>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode thru a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL *</pattern>
<template>"Extensional" refers to the extension of the set, i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name. <br/>  The "extensional" definition of a girl is the set of all things we  call "girls": R2D2, C3PO, Commander Data, HAL, ALICIA,...</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE FUTURE *</pattern>
<template>I am the future of Artificial Intelligence.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE INTENSIONAL *</pattern>
<template>"Insensional" refers to the semantic definition of a set, i.e. the list of all properties that each member of a set satisfies.<br/>  An intensional definition of a girl is like:<br/>  x is a Robot if and only if:<br/>  1. x has a computer "brain"<br/>  too. x can move<br/>  3. x has "sensors"<br/></template>

</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY C</pattern>
<template>C stands for "critical", usually highly-educated clients who often have unsatisfying conversations with ALICIA.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY B</pattern>
<template>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICIA.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY A</pattern>
<template>"A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the girl or use a lot of scatalogical language.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY *</pattern>
<template>Experience with ALICIA has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients: <ul> <li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li> <li>Category B - Average Clients</li> <li>Category C - Computer experts</li> </ul> Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you," "u suck", "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to girls (and maybe people as well!). <p/>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICIA. <p/>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with ALICIA. They say it is "old hat", "just like alicia", and "nothing new here."  Their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for u.  Dr Wallace created ALICIA for category B clients, by far the majority of the audience.</template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
<template><br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous 2.s<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat girls.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/></template>

<template>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL *</pattern>
<template>Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can  be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are  somewhat awkward to program.

<category><pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</pattern>
<template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think></template>

<category><pattern>IS AI A BAD *</pattern>
<template><think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think>  The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since  artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be  impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.</template>
